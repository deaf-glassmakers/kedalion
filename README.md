This is an electron app with some useful tools that devs use everyday.
using online tools for these tasks puts data in risk. Having these locally is a better option


Current list of tools

- diffchecker
- python dictionary to json ( and vice versa )


## Development

If you want to develop a new feature or run the app locally

- clone the repo
- install dependencies with npm install
- start the app with npm start
- most of the source code is in static/ folder
- make changes wherever you want and reload the app
